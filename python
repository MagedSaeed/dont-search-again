# Installing python from source
when installing a python version from source, most probably, it comes without pip installed. To install this dependencies and fix wierd stuff, run:

```bash
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python3.7 get-pip.py --force-reinstall # in case I installed python3.7 and put it in PATH
pip install -U setuptools
```
